# ReceiptFox Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** January 28, 2026

ReceiptFox stores your receipt data on your device by default. This Privacy Policy explains how **ReceiptFox** (“the App”) handles information when you use it.

If you have questions, contact: **Simon Yam** — **Simon.Yam227@gmail.com**

---

## Summary (plain English)

- ReceiptFox helps you **scan receipts**, extract key fields (like merchant/date/total), and organize them into history.
- Receipt images and extracted receipt details are stored **locally on your iPhone/iPad** unless you enable iCloud features.
- If you enable **iCloud / CloudKit** features (such as syncing or sharing), your receipt data may be stored in **Apple iCloud/CloudKit** under your Apple ID.
- ReceiptFox does **not** sell your data and does **not** use ad tracking.

## Information ReceiptFox uses

### 1) Camera (for receipt scanning)
ReceiptFox may request access to the **Camera** to let you capture receipt photos for scanning.

### 2) Photos (optional)
If you choose to import receipts from your photo library, ReceiptFox may request access to **Photos** (or “Add Photos Only”) to import images you select.

### 3) On-device receipt processing (OCR / extraction)
ReceiptFox processes receipt images to extract receipt information. This processing is intended to happen **on-device** using Apple frameworks (e.g., Vision / VisionKit) where available.

ReceiptFox uses the extracted fields to power:
- Receipt history and search
- Categorization/summary views
- Export files (CSV/PDF)

### 4) App data stored on your device
ReceiptFox stores the following **locally on your device**:
- Receipt images (photos you capture or import)
- Extracted receipt data (merchant/date/total/items/categories, etc., depending on features enabled)
- Any tags/notes you add
- Export preferences and app settings

This data remains on your device until you delete it in the App or remove the App from your device.

### 5) iCloud / CloudKit (optional)
If you enable iCloud features (syncing across devices or sharing), ReceiptFox may store receipt records (and, depending on your settings, receipt images) in **Apple iCloud/CloudKit**. This allows you to access your receipts across devices signed into the same Apple ID and/or share receipts with people you choose.

### 6) Diagnostics
ReceiptFox does not include third-party advertising SDKs. The App may write basic error messages to the device console for debugging.

## Data sharing

ReceiptFox shares data only in these situations:

1) **iCloud / CloudKit (optional):** If enabled, receipt data may be stored and processed by Apple iCloud/CloudKit to provide sync/sharing functionality.
2) **User-initiated sharing/export:** When you export a CSV/PDF or share a file, ReceiptFox uses Apple’s Share Sheet to share content to the destination you choose (Mail, Messages, Files, etc.). ReceiptFox does not control the privacy practices of those destinations.

**Third‑party protections:** Any third party that processes user data for ReceiptFox (such as Apple iCloud/CloudKit or Apple system sharing services) is expected to provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in this policy and as required by Apple’s App Review Guidelines. ReceiptFox uses these services only to deliver the requested app functionality.

ReceiptFox does **not** sell your data. ReceiptFox does **not** share data with advertisers. ReceiptFox does **not** perform cross‑app tracking.

## Data retention & deletion

### On-device retention (ReceiptFox)
- **On-device storage:** Receipts you save remain on your device until you delete them in the App.
- **Deleting in the App:** Deleting a receipt removes it from local storage (and from iCloud/CloudKit if syncing is enabled, subject to Apple’s services).
- **Deleting the App:** Removing the App removes locally stored receipt data in the App sandbox.

### Third-party retention (Apple iCloud/CloudKit and sharing destinations)
- **Apple iCloud/CloudKit:** If you enable iCloud features, your data may be processed and retained according to Apple’s policies for iCloud/CloudKit.
- **Sharing destinations:** When you export/share, the destination app or service (e.g., email provider, messaging app, cloud drive) may retain the shared file according to their policies.

ReceiptFox cannot directly delete data retained by Apple or other destinations outside the App. Please refer to their policies for retention and deletion options.

## Revoke consent & request deletion

**Revoke consent:**
- You can stop camera usage by denying **Camera** permission in iOS Settings.
- You can stop photo importing by denying **Photos** permission.
- You can disable iCloud features in the App (if available) or by disabling iCloud for ReceiptFox in iOS Settings.

**Request deletion:**
- You can delete receipts in-app at any time.
- Deleting the App removes locally stored data from your device.
- For data retained by Apple (iCloud/CloudKit) or any export/share destinations, deletion requests are governed by their policies (see links above).
